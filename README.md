Multiplayer Pacman with node.js and socket.io (multiple rooms)

Trying it is as easy as download and write "node app.js" in a console (assuming you have node installed). 
If you dont download the node_modules package you must install them: "npm install express" & "npm install socket.io".

Next step is deploy it on docker and make it open to everyone.
Then i will try to improve performance in mobile phones, and allow them to have a way to move their pacmans.
