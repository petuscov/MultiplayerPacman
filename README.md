Multiplayer Pacman with node.js and socket.io (multiple rooms)

Trying it is as easy as download and write "node app.js" in a console (assuming you have node installed). 
If you dont download the node_modules package you must install them: "npm install express" & "npm install socket.io".

Deployed on heroku!! : http://pacman-multiplayer-jm.herokuapp.com/

Next step should be improve performance in mobile phones, and allow them to have a way to move their pacmans...
